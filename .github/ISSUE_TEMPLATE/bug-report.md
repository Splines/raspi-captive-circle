<!-- Before you open an issue: Have you checked the troubleshooting section? Have you used a search engine to search for your specific problem? It might not be related to this project. Also check that you are not reporting your problem in a kind of XY-problem style: https://www.perlmonks.org/?node=XY+Problem -->

<!-- Note that this is a student project and I plan to fix issues, but only from time to time. Please don't be disappointed if you have to wait several weeks to get a response back from me. If this is too long for you, you might also try to fix the bug on your own and submit a pull request. -->

**Description**
<!-- A clear and concise description of the bug. In the very best case (optionally), you've already done some research and maybe even figured out what is broken, e.g. did not include a vendor prefix for a stylesheet in the browser etc. -->

<!-- Please include screenshots to help explain your problem if applicable -->

**Reproduce**
<!-- Steps to reproduce the behavior. -->

**Expected behavior**
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. The more concise, the less we have to play question-answer-ping-pong. -->

**System**
<!-- Make sure to include version information about your system environment. E.g. your Raspberry Pi distribution and version if your are reporting a bug in the setup script. Or your browser version and OS if you are reporting a bug for the game itself in the browser.-->
